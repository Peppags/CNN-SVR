# CNN-SVR  
## Overview
CNN-SVR is a deep learning-based method for CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA) on-target cleavage efficacy prediction. It is composed of two major components: a merged CNN as the front-end for extracting gRNA and epigenetic features as well as an SVR as the back-end for regression and predicting gRNA cleavage efficiency.

## Content
* **data:** the training and testing examples with gRNA sequence and corresponding epigenetic features and label indicating the on-target cleavage efficacy  
* **weights/weights.h5:** the well-trained weights for our model    
* **cnnsvr.py:** the python code, it can be ran to reproduce our results  

## Usage
#### **python cnnsvr.py**       
**Note:**  
* The input training and testing files should include gRNA sequence with length of 23 bp and four "A-N" symbolic corresponding epigenetic features seuqnces with length of 23 as well as label in each gRNA sequence.    
* The train.csv, test.csv can be replaced or modified to include gRNA sequence and four epigenetic features of interest
